# GSOC2021

JuMP is a modeling interface and a collection of supporting packages for mathematical optimization that is embedded in Julia. With JuMP, users formulate various classes of optimization problems with easy-to-read code, and then solve these problems using state-of-the-art open-source and commercial solvers. JuMP also makes advanced optimization techniques easily accessible from a high-level language.

[JuMP](https://jump.dev/) will be participating as a sub-organization in [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/)'s application for [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). For more information about this application see:

###  Multiobjective optimization

#### Abstract

A key limitation of the current version of JuMP and MathOptInterface is that
they are limited to problems with a single scalar objective function. The goal
of this project is to relax this requirement so that users can model and solve
multi-objective optimization problems.

|  Medium  | Adding support for vector-valued objective functions to MOI and JuMP | [Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow) |

#### Technical Details

Technical details available in this [issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/2099)

#### Helpful Experience

- Knowledge of JuMP and MathOptInterface
- Knowledge of multi-objective optimization

#### Steps

**Initial steps**
- Read [Issue 2099](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/2099)
- Become familiar with previous attempts at vector-valued objectives in JuMP https://github.com/anriseth/MultiJuMP.jl

**Key deliverables**
- Add tests, documentation, and features for vector-valued objective problems to MathOptInterface.
  - Here was the start of a previous attempt: https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/968.
  - Also a reader for the MOP file format: https://github.com/odow/MathOptFormat.jl/pull/95
- Revive this solver for proof-of-concept: https://github.com/odow/MOO.jl.
  - Add more tests, documentation, and features.
  - Add other multi-objective algorithms

**Stretch goal**
- Extend JuMP's `@objective` macro to work with vector-valued functions.

### Matrix-based representation of optimization problems

|  Medium  | Implementation of problem matrix representations and integration in solvers | [Joaquim Dias Garcia](https://github.com/joaquimg),  [Mathieu Besançon](https://github.com/matbesancon), [Benoît Legat](https://github.com/blegat)|

#### Abstract

Many classes of optimization problems are commonly represented using matrices of parameters:

```
l ≤ A x ≤ u
```

These representations can be what optimization solvers require as input or used to transform
optimization problems, for example to derive its dual problem or its KKT conditions.
We want to develop [MatrixOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MatrixOptInterface.jl/)
to federate efforts to build various representations of optimization problems in matrix form.

#### Technical details

The core of the project will the implementation of matrix representations for optimization problems.
These representations can then be used to simplify the code in solver wrappers transforming a
MathOptInterface model into structures that are passed to the native solver.

Beyond the implementation of the various matrix forms, this project will lead possibilities to
work on various connected packages such as solver wrappers,
[Dualization.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Dualization.jl),
[DiffOpt.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/DiffOpt.jl), or
[ParametricOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/ParametricOptInterface.jl).

#### Helpful Experience

- Knowledge of mathematical optimization (linear, quadratic optimization, duality)
- Basic knowledge of MathOptInterface

#### Steps

**Initial steps**

- Read the MathOptInterface manual and get familiar with the data structures used to represent scalar and vector functions
- Read on the models already implemented in [matrix form](https://github.com/jump-dev/MatrixOptInterface.jl/)

**Key deliverables**

- Implement various forms for linear, conic and quadratic optimization problems in MatrixOptInterface
- Design user-oriented documentation for building and consuming the various problem formats
- Replace the conversion code from MOI structures in solvers with the MatrixOptInterface implementation

**Stretch goals**

- Integrate MatrixOptInterface in ParametricOptInterface, Dualization.jl, DiffOpt.jl, BilevelJuMP.jl

###  Chordal decomposition of SDP

#### Abstract

Chordal decomposition is a key step in the formulation of sparse SDP.
Implementations are already available
in [SumOfSquares](https://github.com/jump-dev/SumOfSquares.jl/)
and [COSMO](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/COSMO.jl).

| **Priority** | **Involves** | **Mentors** |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
|  Medium  | Creating Chordal extension and decomposition packages | [Joaquim Dias Garcia](https://github.com/joaquimg), [Benoît Legat](https://github.com/blegat) |

#### Abstract

Many semidefinite problems are sparse and exploiting this sparsity can significantly
reduce the computation time and memory needed to solve the problem.

The goal of this project is to refactor existing implementation of chordal sparsity reduction into a MathOptInterface layer that is easy to plug into any SDP solver as a transformation layer.

#### Technical details

COSMO and SumOfSquares currently implement algorithms for chordal completion/extension.
The core of this project is to create a package containg these algorithms for chordal graphs
with test, documentation and benchmarks.
Then, this package will be used to create another package implementing a MathOptInterface
layer for chordal sparsity decomposition.

#### Helpful Experience

- Knowledge of mathematical optimization (semidefinite programming)
- Knowledge of graph theory and chordal graphs (see *Chordal Graphs and Semidefinite Optimization* by Lieven Vandenberghe and Martin S. Andersen)
- Basic knowledge of MathOptInterface

#### Steps

**Initial steps**

- Read the MathOptInterface manual and get familiar with the data structures used to represent scalar and vector functions
- Read the implementation of algorithms on chordal graphs
in [SumOfSquares](https://github.com/jump-dev/SumOfSquares.jl/)
and [COSMO](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/COSMO.jl).

**Key deliverables**

- Create a Chordal.jl package with algorithms on chordal graphs
- Create a ChordalOptInterface.jl package an MOI layer doing chordal sparsity decomposition

**Stretch goals**

- Allow chordal decomposition to be an easy to use option from JuMP that works with any semidefinite solver.
